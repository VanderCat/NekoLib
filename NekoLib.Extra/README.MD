# NekoLib's Extra

extra stuff that does not belong in NekoLib, but usefull for game creation,
like HotReloadService implementation, Logging helper, Damping, Simple IScene implementation
to use, along with a default persistant scene.
Most of the time you don't need anything more than BaseScene anyway, but all stuff are virtual
do whatever you want idk
